Takeaways
1. Properly planning your time is key.
2. Be sure to create notes prior to class, and add to them during the lecture.

Strategies
1. Add an additional time buffer to due dates, by planning to turn in projects 48 hours in advance of the due date.
2. Take time immediately after class to finish any notes I'm taking while they are still fresh.
